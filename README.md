# Mobile Software Applications (Android, Kotlin)

Here are the Android Apps I created during my time at AIT - Budapest during the summer 2019.

## Final Project ("Graph My Travels")
Ever wondered what percent of the EU you've visited? Or maybe you're curious about what countries have visited the moon? If you like graphs and travelling, then this is the app for you!

This app lets you:
1. Keep track of the countries you've visited
2. Learn about countries you've visited and others next up on your list
3. Generate graphs about your travels!
